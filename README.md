# WintabDN
This is a fork of Wacom WintabDN project

I've cloned and forked the project to fix some bug I discovered in the source-code.

Unfortunately original project repository (see bottom links) contains only the ZIP of the source and don't allow to for direct forking.

I'm keeping the MIT license of Wacom but you should include my name in the credits section of your project repository and in the credits window/screen of your running program using this lib. See MIT-license.txt file
